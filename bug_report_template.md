## Impact

David Lassig was tasked with performing an internal penetration test towards
EvilCorp Network. An internal penetration test is a dedicated
attack against internally connected systems. The focus of this test is
to perform attacks, similar to those of a hacker and attempt to
infiltrate EvilCorps internal netowrk. My overall objective was to evaluate the
network, identify systems, and exploit flaws while reporting the
findings back to EvilCorp.

When performing the internal penetration test, there were several
alarming vulnerabilities that were identified on EvilCorps
network. When performing the attacks, I was able to gain access to
multiple machines, primarily due to outdated patches and poor security
configurations. During the testing, I had administrative level access
to multiple systems. All systems were successfully exploited and access
granted. These systems as well as a brief description on how access was
obtained are listed below:
